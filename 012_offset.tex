\section{Offset Non-Uniform Discrete Cosine Decomposition of Toeplitz Matrices}

Diagonalization of a Toeplitz matrix (or the related Henkel matrix) is well known for about 100 years due to CarathÃ©odory. Recently, the methods and techniques were formalized and were shown to be related to non-uniform discrete Fourier transformation (DFT). In this post, we look at a straightforward extension to non-uniform discrete cosine transformation (DCT) for real-valued Toeplitz matrices.

Introduction

Let $\boldsymbol{T}$ be an $N\times N$ real, symmetric, Toeplitz matrix with simple eigenvalues. The matrix admits a Vandermonde decomposition [2], [3] given by \[\boldsymbol{T} = \boldsymbol{V}^\text{H} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{V}\] where $\boldsymbol{V}$ is an $N\times N$ complex-valued Vandermonde matrix with powers of roots of unity, $\nu_0, \dots, \nu_{N-1},$ hereafter referred to as modes, along the columns (shown below), and $\boldsymbol{D}$ is an $N\times N$ non-negative diagonal matrix.

\[
\boldsymbol{V} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \nu_0 & \nu_0^2 & \cdots & \nu_0^{N-1} \\
	1 & \nu_1 & \nu_1^2 & \cdots & \nu_1^{N-1} \\
	1 & \vdots &  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
	1 & \nu_{N-1} & \nu_{N-1}^2 & \cdots & \nu_{N-1}^{N-1}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Absence of a Non-Uniform Cosine Decomposition

Theorem 2.1. (Absence of a general NUCD). There exists no uniform cosine decomposition \[\boldsymbol{T} = \boldsymbol{C}^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{C}\] for the matrix $\boldsymbol{T}$ for $N > 2.$

Note: $\boldsymbol{C}$ is an $N\times N$ real, cosine matrix and $\boldsymbol{D}$ an $N\times N$ positive diagonal matrix. The elements of $\boldsymbol{C}$ are given by  \[ [\boldsymbol{C}]_{mn} = \cos(n \theta_m), \]
where $m, n = 0,\dots, N - 1,$ and $\theta_m \in (-\pi,\pi].$

Proof. Let $\tau_{m,n}$ and $\delta_{ m,n}$ denote the $(m,n)$ terms of the matrices $\boldsymbol{T}$ and $\boldsymbol{D},$ respectively. Expanding $\boldsymbol{C}^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{C}$ and equating the diagonal elements we have \[ \tau_{n,n} = \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} \delta_{m,m} \cos^2 (n \theta_m),\]
where $n = 0,\dots,N-1.$ Therefore, the first element $\tau_{0,0}$ is \[\tau_{0,0} = \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} \delta_{m,m}.\] Due to the Toeplitz structure of $\boldsymbol{T}$, we have equality of the diagonal elements, i.e., $\tau_{0,0} = \tau_{1,1} = \cdots = \tau_{N-1,N-1}.$ However, since for any $\theta \in (-\pi,\pi]$ we have $0 \leq \cos^2 (\theta ) \leq 1$ with upper-bound equality only for $\theta = \{0,\pi\},$ no angles beyond $\{0,\pi\}$ can satisfy the equality of the diagonal elements. Hence, such a decomposition does not exist. $\blacksquare$


Result of the above theorem motivates us to explore offset non-uniform cosine decomposition where the decomposition is scaled as $\boldsymbol{T} = \gamma^2 \boldsymbol{C}^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{C}$ for some  $\gamma > 1,$ wherefore equality of the diagonal elements may be met.

Offset Non-Uniform Cosine Decomposition

Lemma 3.1. The modes $\nu_1, \dots, \nu_{N-1},$ are either real or appear in complex conjugate pairs using the algorithm given in [2] with a real initial value $\nu_0.$

Note: The only admissible real initial values are $\nu_0 = \pm 1.$

Proof. Modes are the polynomial roots of $A(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \alpha_k z^k,$ where $\alpha_ k$ is the $k$-th element of the vector $\boldsymbol{a}$ given by solving $\boldsymbol{Ta} = \boldsymbol{v}$ [2]. Here, $\boldsymbol{v}$ is the initial value vector given by $\boldsymbol{v} = [1, \nu_0, \nu_0^2,\dots,\nu_0^{N-1}].$

For real initial value vectors, the coeffcients $\alpha_k$ of the polynomial $A(z)$ are real. Therefore, the roots of the polynomial are either real or appear in complex conjugate pairs. $\blacksquare$

Now we present the main result of this post.

Theorem 3.2 (O-NUCD). For real initial values, there exists an offset non-uniform cosine decomposition $\boldsymbol{T} = 2 \boldsymbol{C}^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{C}$ for the matrix $\boldsymbol{T}.$

Note: $\boldsymbol{C}$ is an $N\times N$ real, cosine matrix and $\boldsymbol{D}$ an $N\times N$ positive diagonal matrix. The elements of the matrix $\boldsymbol{C}$ are given by \[
[\boldsymbol{C}]_{m,n} = \cos\left(\mp \frac{\pi}{4} + n \theta_m\right),\] where $m,n = 0,\dots,N-1,$  and $\theta_m = \angle \nu_m.$

Proof. Let $\boldsymbol{V}_R$ and $\boldsymbol{V}_I$ denote the real and imaginary parts of the Vandermonde matrix $\boldsymbol{V}.$ As the initial values are real, from Lemma 3.1, the roots are either real or have complex conjugate symmetry. Therefore, we have the following orthogonality properties: \[\boldsymbol{V}_R^\text{T} \boldsymbol{V}_I = \boldsymbol{V}_R^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{V}_I = \boldsymbol{V}_I^\text{T} \boldsymbol{V}_R = \boldsymbol{V}_I^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{V}_R =\boldsymbol{0}.\] Using these properties (twice), we have \[\boldsymbol{T} =  \boldsymbol{V}_R^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{V}_R +  \boldsymbol{V}_I^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{V}_I = (\boldsymbol{V}_R \pm \boldsymbol{V}_I)^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} (\boldsymbol{V}_R \pm \boldsymbol{V}_I) = 2 \boldsymbol{C}^\text{T} \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{C},\] with the elements of the matrix $\boldsymbol{C}$ as shown above. $\blacksquare$

O-NUCD in MATLAB using the Vandermonde Tools [1]
As an example, O-NUCD ($-\frac{\pi}{4}$) may be found using the Vandermonde Tools from AudioLabs [1] as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
>> [v,d] = find_vand('xcorr', T) ;
>> V = vandermonde_fast(v) ;
>> D = diag(d) ;
>> norm(V'*D*V - T)
ans = 2.5403e-15

>> C = cos(-pi/4 + angle(v)*(0:N-1)) ;
>> norm(2*C'*D*C - T)
ans = 2.0304e-15
\end{verbatim}
